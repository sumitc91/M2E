                    <div class="row">                       
                        <div class="col-md-12">
                            <div class="box box-solid">
                                <div class="box-body">
                                <p>You would have been thinking of some cool college students who came up with a world changing idea or a technical geek who tried to build the next Facebook. We do not belong to any of these categories.</p>
                                <p>Let me tell you a story. There were three engineering students, who during their engineering days believed that being financially independent during early stages of life is important. They ventured into all kinds of business, even weirdest online jobs like captcha entry, data entry, proof reading and the list goes on! But none of them gave these young boys financial as well as mental satisfaction. They even saw their fellow beings going around in gambling, betting and other illegal stuffs for cash|money. Many landed up in deep trouble.</p>
                                <p>We thought all these are done by students to earn that extra money which they believe can help them enjoy their college life in a better way. No wrong! But most of the online jobs hardly pay anything, setback those illegal works.</p>
                                <p>This thought was intensified by the fact that most of the students in developing countries are financially independent(they even manage their fees). For an average Indian student a $100 is enough to meet his monthly personal expense. So we during those late night drinking sessions in local bars discussed this one question - how can all of us earn a minimum of $100 during college days without much hectic effort?</p>
                                <p>After trying and failing a lot, slowly like any mediocre startups we also diffused into our personal life concentrating on academics and the so called placements, nothing but frustration banks.</p>
                                <p>I(Albin Thomas) came to US for doing my Master's whereas my fellow partners ended up as one of the rarest breed of students who get placed in a great software company in India ( They are Deva Gopal Chanchal and Summit Chourasia). These two guys are great coders and are really passionate about their work.</p>
                                <p>Okay let's continue the story. Even being separated by distance, that particular thought to help the upcoming generation to earn that $100 for an independent life grew up again. But this time with full energy and enthusiasm. We thought of variety of ways in doing this. There were lot of online job sites like freelancer.com, elance.com etc. But for a new comer especially from India, its like work for $5 or just bid and apply for jobs. So there was a gap for a something new - a steady good paying job.</p>
                                <p>We wanted to provide the above 1.5 million undergraduate students in India an opportunity to earn without affecting their personal life and study. So we designed a platform that enable students to earn Rs 10-100 per task. Now again what is the task?</p>
                                <p>Of the millions of students in India, mostly more than 90% of students have accessibility to a mobile or a computer with an internet connection. Most of them do have smartphones/tablets -not a big deal.</p>
                                <p>The outsourcing industry ( USA to India) is a huge one. TCS, Infosys, Wipro -names familiar for all engineering students are just mediators. We have our friends working in these so called reputed companies. All they force such bright engineers of a developing country to do is to sit in a bench and do data entry and testing of apps and software. I bet even a high school student can do this with a seven day training. ( Sorry for this small detour).</p>
                                <p>Coming back, yes we do what these company this do. We outsource works from us and our in house platform ( that we created after an year of testing) finds jobs and divides them into small parts and assigns to users. All jobs could be completed in 10-15 min and pay would be range of Rs 10 -100.</p>
                                <p>So an average student if he spends an hour would be able to earn nearly Rs 200 per day. I guess that's enough for a movie and a good restaurant visit. </p>
                                <p>Yup that's what we are doing. Enabling everyone with internet connectivity earn a bit! </p>
                                <p>Lot of issues are going to rise, but we are confident that with support from our users we will be able to overcome our difficulties. </p>
